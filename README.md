# liri-node-app

## What is LIRI?

### LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


### liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

### * my-tweets

### * spotify-this-song

### * movie-this

### * do-what-it-says

## How To Get Started

### In the command line, enter:
### node liri.js
### followed by either 'my-tweets', 'spotify-this-song', 'movie-this', or 'do-what-it-says' (quotes are NOT neccessary).
### A song should be entered after 'spotify-this-song', if that option is used.
### A movie title should be entered after 'movie this', if that option is used.
### For 'do-what-it-says', the command and input will be read from random.txt. The file should list the command first (such as spotify-this-song, followed by a comma (,) and then the input (such as I Want It That Way) - all on one line. Please view the file to further understand the proper format.
